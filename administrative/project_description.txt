This paper shows that "both natural odors and human perceptual descriptions of smells can be described using a three-dimensional hyperbolic space."
This theory can be brought into practice by applying the HypLL hyperbolic machine learning library to the data.
By attempting to solve a problem using both hyperbolic and standard euclidean machine learning we can gain insights into both the hyperbolic space of the olfactory system, and the applications of hyperbolic machine learning.
